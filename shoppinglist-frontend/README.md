# ShoppinglistFrontend

This project represents a shopping list, that makes it possible to fill the list directly from recipes.
On top of that it provides the utility of being able to sort your list based on the type of items youre facing in the supermarket, to reduce the amount of times going back and forth between aisles, because you forgot an item in a previous section.

The frontend is structured in main pages located at src/pages. 
The frontpage is the shopping list itself, where its possible to cross off entries, but only clear them later in case crossing them off was a mistake. Furthermore its possible to add items and recipes from a dropdown selection.
The ingredient-admin page is responsible for creating new items, editing existing ones and deleting them. 
The recipes-admin page is responsible for linking items together into recipes, making it possible to fill the list quickly and easily.

The entire project uses the daisy-ui design system.
